<p>Making mokups i got tired of my non-collaborative floating divs so i made this very simple adaptive grid to quickly start new project.</p>


<p>It's a very simple self explanatory layout... each class has a % width... see adaptiveGridDemo.html for a quick demo or just follow the "live demo" link.</p>
