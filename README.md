<a href="http://www.lucalorenzini.org/adaptiveGrid/demo/adaptiveGridDemo.html">I'm a live demo, try me!</a>

<p>Doing mokups i got tired of non-collaborative floating divs so i made this very simple adaptive grid to quickly start a new project.</p>


<p>It's a very simple self explanatory layout, each class has a % width. See adaptiveGridDemo.html for a quick demo or just follow the live demo link.</p>
