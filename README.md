<h3>Adaptive grid: simple css adaptive grid layout.</h3>

<h4>Tired of my non-collaborative floating divs in my mokups i made this very simple adaptive grid to quickly start my new project.</h4>
<h4>It's a very simple self explanatory layout... each class has a % width... see adaptiveGridDemo.html for a quick demo.</h4>
