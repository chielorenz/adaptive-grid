##Adaptive grid: simple css adaptive grid layout
[I'm a live demo, try me!](http://http://www.lucalorenzini.org/projects/adaptiveGrid/demo/adaptiveGridDemo.html)

###Idea:
Doing mokups i got tired of non-collaborative floating divs so i made this very simple adaptive grid to quickly start a new project... and share it on github.

###About project:
It's a very simple self explanatory layout, each class has a % width. See adaptiveGridDemo.html for a quick demo or just follow the live demo link.
